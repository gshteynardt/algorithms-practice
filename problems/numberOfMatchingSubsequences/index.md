# Number of Matching Subsequences
Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".

### Результат
Your function should return the number of subsequence s.
